''' Question <>
Cats and Dogs'''

# Pseudo code
1. Read total number of testcase
2. For each test case:
3. Read the values of number of cats, dogs and legs
4. If number of cats are less than two times that of dogs, minimum=d*4
5. Else minimum=[d+(c-2*d)]*4
6. Define maximum=(d+c)*4
7. If number of legs are in multiple of 4 and lies in between minimum and maximum, print "yes"
8. Else print "no"
9. Goto next test case


# Code


# Read number of test cases
t=int(input())

# For every test case
for _ in range(t):

	# Read the values of number of cats, dogs and legs
    c,d,l= [int(i) for i in input().split()]
    
    # If number of cats are less than two times that of dogs, minimum=d*4
    if c<=2*d:
        minimum=d*4
    # Otherwise minimum=[d+(c-2*d)]*4
    else:
        minimum=[d+(c-2*d)]*4
    
    # Define maximum=(d+c)*4
    maximum=(d+c)*4
    
    # If number of legs are in multiple of 4 and lies in between minimum and maximum, print "yes"
    if (l>=minimum and l<=maximum and l%4==0):
        print("yes")
        
    # Else print "no"
    else:
        print("no")
