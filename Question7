'''Question 7 
  Sticks'''
  
#Pseudo code
1. taking input number of test cases
2. for loop for each test cases
3. taking input number of list
4. taking all the input of list
5. creating a list m
6. for loop in range 0 - len(list), counting number of times i-th list element appears in list,
  if appear more than 1 time then we append its value in list m
7. if length of list m is greater than 3 then we will sort list m and reverse its items 
8. on multiplying first and last index value of list m, we can get maximum area of rectangle
9. Goto next test case



#code




try:
    #taking number of test cases
    t=int(input())
    #for loop for each test cases
    for i in range(t):
        #each test contains n input
        n=int(input())
        #list contains input
        l=list(map(int,input().split()))
        
        #creating a list m
        m=[]
        for i in range(0,len(l)):
            #storing, number of times  l[i] appears, in a 
           a=l.count(l[i])
           #if value appears more than 1 times then we can append list m
           if(a>1):
                m.append(l[i])
                
        #rectangle can be form only when length of list will be greater than 3
        if(len(m)>3):
            #sort the list m
            m.sort()
           
            #reverse the list
            m.reverse()
            
            #multiply 0th index value of list and 3rdindex value of list for area of triangle
            print(m[0]*m[3])
        #if length of list if equal to or less than 3 then print "-1"
        else:
            print('-1')
    
        
except:
    pass
