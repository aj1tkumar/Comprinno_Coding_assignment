  #pseudo code
  1.taking number of test cases
  2. for loop for each test cases
  3. taking number of iteams in list
  4. taking list values
  5. checking condition if list first element and last element is 1 and number of iteams in list is 
    odd and every next element is increasing exactly by 1
  6. if satisfied all condition then print "yes" else "no"
