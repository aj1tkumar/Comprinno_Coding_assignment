'''Question 4
  Bear and Milky Cookies'''
  
#pseudo Code
1. taking input number of test cases
2. for loop for each test cases
3. taking input number of task done by bear
4. creating list of task
5. for loop for each iteam of list, taking c = 1, if i == "cookie" increase c by 1,
  if i != "cookie" set c = 0
  if c==2 i.e. bear eaten two cookies continuously, break loop and print "no"
  if after completing for loop , value of c ==0 then print "yes" else "no"
6. Goto next test case



#Code


#for loop for number of test cases
for _ in range(int(input())):
    #taking input n minutes 
    n = int(input())
    #creating list of task
    l = input().split()
    c=0
    #for loop for each task done by bear
    for i in l:
        #if i == "cookie" then increasing c value by 1
        if i=="cookie":
            c+=1
        #else set value of c as 0
        else:
            c=0
        #if c == 2 i.e. bear each two cookies continuously     
        if c==2:
            break
    #if after performing task by bear value of c == 0  then print "yes"
    if c==0:
        print("YES")
        #if c!= 0 then print "no"
    else: 
        print("NO")
